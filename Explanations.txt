Before this we opened anaconda prompt pasted our folder location with cd beginning 
then we wrote code . it opens VS with the folder

In VS:
first we create env in the folder = > conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
conda activate venv/ to activate the env use cmd promt here!

we need to clone and sync with github. with git init
We created our readme here.
then git add README.md after we commit git commit -m "First Commit"
to check git status we can simple write git status!

git remote add origin https://github.com/flyingriverhorse/mlproject.git
git remote -v
git branch -M main

to push: git push -u origin main

Before this we opened anaconda prompt pasted our folder location with cd beginning 
then we wrote code . it opens VS with the folder

In VS:
first we create env in the folder = > conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
conda activate venv/ to activate the env use cmd promt here!

we need to clone and sync with github. with git init
We created our readme here.
then git add README.md after we commit git commit -m "First Commit"
to check git status we can simple write git status!

git remote add origin https://github.com/flyingriverhorse/mlproject.git
git remote -v
git branch -M main

to push: git push -u origin main

to see your which acc connected git config --global user.email

after we need to create .gitignore in repository and choose python 
we can use after to sync git pull the changes.

---------------

After all We create setup.py and requirement.txt
responsible of creating ML application as a package. We can also install this package in our projects. So with it help
will be able to build entire machine learning application as a package and even deploy in py, anybody can use it.

we wrote our code in it.

if we need 100 packages then we create function
------

we created src folder and created __init__.py file directly consider src and build

----
we created in setup to read reqirement.txt function so we do not need to write each time. 

now we can install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt

git add . git commit -m "SETUP" git push -u origin main 

technically we can do directly from VS commiting. 

git push -u origin main

----------
src file we created components  file and created __init__.py this folder mainly for training

-----
pipeline training and prediction

---

we edited exception for errors 

logger for log info from the message 

to test python src/logger.py to check if everythin is fine!


-----

to install kernel
conda install -p c:\Users\Murat\mlproject\venv ipykernel --update-deps --force-reinstall
